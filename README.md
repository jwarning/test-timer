# Test Timer

A simple test timer application written in Windows Forms.

It was originally created according to a specification, however it is available
to anyone to freely use or modify in any way.

The interface includes the current time, the time of the next test and a
running indicator to visually indicate the time until the next test.

A set of traffic lights will appear on the left to indicate that the next test
will be due soon. The default time between tests is one hour, however the next
test time can be brought forward to a custom time as well.

## Lights
- Green: 15 minutes to go
- Yellow: 10 minutes to go
- Red & Flashing: 5 minutes to go
